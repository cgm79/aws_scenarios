# AWS Scenarios

The purpose of this repository is to manage a collection of real-world, hands-on scenarios which can be used while you study for a specific AWS certification or to learn more about how a particular service works.

These scenarios are intended to be used in addition to traditional learning materials, such as videos, documentation, and so on.

Each scenario will be structured to push you to think about how to implement the solutions on your own, rather than just providing a step-by-step list of clicks.  There *will* be hints along the way if you get stuck, but you are encouraged to think through each scenario first.
