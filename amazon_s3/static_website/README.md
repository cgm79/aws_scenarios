# Static website

This scenario will create a simple website.

## Topics difficulty

This is a relatively straightforward scenario which is expected to utilize the following services:

* EC2 instance
* Route53
* Load balancers
* EC2 auto-scaling groups
* 

## Cost estimates

If you do not have an active free tier account, then this scenario **may** incur a small cost:
* EC2 instance
* Public IP address

## Objectives

* Deploy an EC2 instance with a public IP address
* Deploy an DNS Alias record in Route53
* Deploy a load balancer
* Configure ELB health checks
* Create an auto-scaling group
* Change the load balancer to multi-AZ
*
